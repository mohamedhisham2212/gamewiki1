                        <p>BioShock Infinite is the third game in the series and takes place in the airborne city of Columbia in 1912,<br> 
                            where the player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced ex-Pinkerton agent. Booker has been given<br>
                            the job of finding a mysterious and powerful woman imprisoned in Columbia since birth named Elizabeth in order<br>
                            to wipe his debts away, andthe story follows the unlikely duo as they journey to escape the flying city<br>
                            while discovering its twisted secrets.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Following in the footsteps of previous BioShock games, the world of Infinite explores the chaos that results when strong ideals are taken to an extreme. Here,<br>
                            the philosophical concept of "American Exceptionalism" is perverted into ultranationalism, religious fanaticism, and social Darwinism.<br>
                            Flags, patriotic music,and propaganda posters promote the idea that Columbia is a 'haven' from the so-called 'unwanted' of the world, as the player progressively learns more about its society,<br>
                            inhabitants, and the darkness that lies within it.</p>

                        off the coast of Maine. With instructions from the Luteces to "bring us the girl and wipe away the debt",<br>
                        DeWitt enters the structure which houses a rocket silo that transports him to the flying city of Columbia.<br>
                        Booker's presence in Columbia goes unnoticed until a policeman identifies the letters "AD" branded on his hand.<br>
                        This is a sign of the 'False Shepherd' which city leader and prophet,<b>Zachary Comstock</b>,<br>
                        prophesied would 'lead the lamb (<b>Elizabeth</b>) astray' and bring about Columbia's downfall. Booker, now a wanted man, fights his way to Monument Island where Elizabeth is held within a tower.<br>
                         Along the way, he discovers a large device called the Siphon and the ability Elizabeth wields which can open Tears,which will lead them to a unique adventure to solve the mystery of Elizabeth<br>

                        When Booker frees her from her tower on Monument Island, the Founders, Zachary Hale Comstock, and Songbird are all determined to recapture her at any cost.</p>

                    <p>BioShock Infinite was developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K Games, with Ken Levine working on the game as the creative director and lead writer.
                         Irrational and Levine, who had previously developed the original BioShock, passed on the opportunity to work on the sequel BioShock 2 in favor of 
                         a new BioShock game with a different setting,with Take-Two Interactive allowing them the freedom to develop it.Work on Infinite began in February 2008,
                          with the game's concept being formed six months after the original BioShock's release.Under the moniker "Project Icarus",Irrational worked in secrecy
                          on Infinite for two-and-a-half years prior to its announcement on August 12, 2010.The game's development took about five years, with it finally announced
                          as going gold on February 19, 2013.Irrational's work on the game required a team of about 200 people,while also receiving substantial assistance from developer company 2K Australia,
                          which was formerly part of Irrational Games.</p>
